# Create Post App

This is a simple JavaScript application that lets users create posts, like them, and add comments. The app is purely client-side and does not use any backend or database, so all posts, likes, and comments disappear when the page is refreshed. Itâ€™s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is easy to use with a clean interface.
